## Hosting on GitHub Pages

You can freely host static files (e.g. HTML, JS, CSS, images, etc. but not PHP, Ruby, etc.) using GitHub Pages. Just make a branch called `gh-pages`. You can even point your own domain at this site. I use this for almost all my sites!

1. Make a new GitHub project (or start with an old one).
2. Switch to the `gh-pages` branch with:
    
        git branch gh-pages
        git checkout gh-pages

3. Put your files there (e.g. index.html, etc.) and push it to GitHub.
4. You can now access that at `http://USERNAME.github.com/PROJECTNAME`
