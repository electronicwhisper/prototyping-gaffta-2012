## Resources

For learning solid JavaScript, I highly recommend Doug Crockford's [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596517742/). It is concise but thorough, and highlights the most powerful features of JavaScript. See also his videos and articles, [linked from here](http://javascript.crockford.com/).

For staying abreast of the latest HTML5 technologies, I recommend [HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/). Articles tend to be up-to-date and written by authors within the browser development community.

For checking browser compatibility, I recommend [caniuse](http://caniuse.com/) and [HTML5 Please](http://html5please.com/). Btw, a *polyfill* is a small JS library which hacks in support for a new feature to a browser that doesn't yet support it.
